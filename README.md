# HW2
This is my second homework assignment in Software Design with Michael Colbert.

We're tasked with creating html pages and formatting said pages with CSS style formatting.

This repository will be containing all relavent information/files needed to complete said assignment - I'll be committing throughout my process in order to keep track of my work up to 'release' of my webpages.
